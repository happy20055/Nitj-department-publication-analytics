## Dataset
- 1,500+ publication records  
- Time span: 1991–2024  
- Data includes journals, conferences, book chapters, and research projects  
- Source: Institutional academic records (converted from Excel to CSV)

---

## What Was Done
- Cleaned and standardized raw publication data  
- Handled missing years and inconsistent categories  
- Analyzed faculty-level and department-level research output  
- Created multiple visualizations to highlight trends and comparisons  

---

## Visualizations
- Line charts for year-wise trends  
- Bar and stacked bar charts for comparison  
- Pie charts for publication distribution  
- Sankey diagram for faculty–publication relationships  
- Word clouds, box plots, and scatter plots for deeper insights
